  <h1>Seeing Networks in Philadelphia</h1>
  
  <h2><p>Philadelphia’s network infrastructure is messy, clumsy, and often unseen by the general public. Wandering the streets, you may get a vague understanding of what's going on—a manhole cover sits unassumingly on the crosswalk, or maybe a mysterious box with an antenna sits high upon a wall in a back alley, humming into the night. Under your feet and above your eye line, data is soaring by through brightly-lit fiber cable and ethereal radio transmission. The city is alive, but few may ever under stand to what extent.</p>

<p>What follows below is an ever-changing, work-in-progress project to present information about the network infrastructure as it exists within Philadelphia. Readers are encouraged to reach out by emailing <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#115;&#111;&#102;&#112;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#119;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#115;&#111;&#102;&#112;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> to share observations, photos, and information that may be suitable for the site.

            <h2>PECO</h2>
            <p>PECO, formerly Philadelphia Electric Company, was formed in 1881 to construct and maintain infrastructure to supply electricity to Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs. PECO owns 1,607 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, 15,250 square miles of underground distribution cable, and 12,933 miles of aerial distribution lines. It is currently owned by the Exelon Corporation, and merged with Commonwealth Edison's holding company Unicom Corp in 2000.</p>

            <h2>Keystone Telephone Company</h2>
            <p>Keystone Telephone Company began its existence in 1900 as a direct competitor to Bell Telephone Company. Keystone is often credited as the first phone system in the world with all wires installed via underground conduit. Primarily catering to businesses, Keystone also initially served municipal, fire, and police communications. Bell finally bought out Keystone in 1945, and subsequently retired the company's infrastructure due to redundancies. Keystone Telephone Company manhole covers are still in service, but the conduit is now owned by PECO, where one can assume it is used for electrical cabling.</p>

            <h2>Western Union Telegraph Company</h2>
            <p>Western Union began operation in 1851, quickly creating a vast telegraph network across the United States. By 1983, Western Union's international cable system properties were sold to MCI Communications (now owned by Verizon Communications). Western Union sent its last telegram in 2006, but it is unknown whether or not older telegraph lines were pulled out of operation before this time, or if domestic telegraph infrastructure was included in the deal with MCI Communications. The hexagonal pattern on these manholes was a standard for telecommunications at the time; it is often seen today on telephone company manholes.</p>

            <p>Bell Telephone began as a company in 1879, and started operating Philadelphia within the same year. In 1984, the Bell system (then known as AT&T) was broken into seven "Baby Bell" companies, which led to Philadelphia being serviced by the new Bell Atlantic. In 2000, Bell Atlantic merged with the Connecticut-based GTE Corporation to form Verizon Communications, which still services the city of Philadelphia.</p>

            <p>Originally launched in 1993 as National Fiber Network, Metromedia focused on running dark fiber to communications carriers in the U.S. and Europe. The  company filed for bankruptcy in 2002, though it re-emerged in 2003 under the name Abovenet. In 2007, the company acquired fiver from AT&T and Verizon that was being sold to comply with antitrust law. The infrastructure is currently owned by the Zayo Group.</p>

They are a major Tier 1 network, which means that their network has a direct connection to every other network online without paying fees to do so. In 2012, Level 3 received a $411 million contract from the Department of Defense's Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to provide fiber cable and maintenance support to DoD networks. This is just something that is interesting to know. They were purchased by CenturyLink in 2017.</p>

            <p>The HPFS, considered to first debut in Philadelphia, was a high pressure fire system servicing red hydrants throughout the city, starting in 1903. The 56 mile system was praised for greatly reducing the number of fires in the city, and could shoot a two-inch stream 230 feet vertically. The system eventually fell into disrepair following improvements in fire engines and sprinkler systems, leading to decommission in 2005.</p>
			
			<p>While you may see several red hydrants around the city, the HPFS hydrants are much wider and feature two independent gates (as opposed to the usual one). There is a color code associated with fire hydrant bonnets (tops) within the city (aside from fully red HPFS hydrants): Red for hydrants with 16" or larger mains, green for hydrants with mains between 10" and 16", and orange for hydrants with mains 8" or smaller.</p>

			<p>This handhole is likely used by a provider to deliver cable television services to a a building. While cable television came to Philadelphia in 1983 under three franchises: Comcast, Cablevisions Systems of Philadelphia, and Philadelphia Inner City Cable (with a fourth, Wade Cablevision coming in 1987), Comcast now controls all cable within the city.

It appears that the "Bell South" logo may have been etched or scratched into the surface of the manhole cover by hand. Note also that "Bell South" is not the canonical spelling of BellSouth, which is sometimes stylized as BELLSOUTH, but never includes a space. Further investigation is needed.</p>

    <h1>Street Markings</h1>
    <span id="mark"><h2>Sometimes you'll see a manhole cover that is surrounded with colorful markings. Whenever a contractor or construction company plans to do street excavation, utility companies will mark out the location of their underground cables so that the contractor knows to watch out for them. 
</h2><h2>
There's a federal color-code standard for sidewalk markings. Philadelphia follows that standard.
</h2><h2>
Orange refers to the broad catch-all of "Communications, alarm, signal lines, cables and conduit." This means that orange lines can be internet cables, television cables, telephone lines, or other kinds of conduits. 
</h2><h2>
The markings are sometimes really sloppy, and often in fragments. Sometimes you'll see several different labels in the same place. A lot of these cables are bundled up together running through ducts under the city.

            <p>How do you define "here", when "here" is subject to alteration by construction, or physical change over time? The National Geodetic Survey, a US Federal agency, maintains a network of graphic markers across the United States, including Philadelphia.</p>

<p>These markers can be explored on the National Geodetic Survey Data Explore website at
<a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/NGSDataExplorer/">https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/NGSDataExplorer/</a></p>

<p>Sometimes taking the the form of a metal disk implanted in a sidewalk or road, or sometimes a physical building structure, each marker in the NGS Network is described by a data sheet as described <a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/DATASHEET/dsdata.pdf">here</a>

<p>These data sheets describe how to find the markers, the form the markers take, and location notes from recent surveyors on the condition of the markers. While some markers are on sidewalks publicly accessible, others can be in difficult to reach places such as a top City Hall on the William Penn statue. Though locations are chosen for perceived physical permanence, markers can go missing over time due to construction, theft, or vandalism.</p>

            <h2>Traffic Signal Controllers</h2>
            <p><p>
These dark green signal control boxes attached to traffic signal posts are just one piece of a massive system of networked objects. The system, designed by the North Carolina-based transit services company TransitScore, combines data collected by real-time traffic cameras, RFID (radio frequency identification) scanners, and other field sensors to create traffic signal times that adapt to the immediate conditions of traffic. Each signal control box contains wireless routing equipment and traffic controllers that connect back to a fiber hub. The little green dome on top of the signal control is actually a powerful wireless router used  for communicating with the other sensors in the traffic network and the city’s Traffic Management Center in Long Island City.
</p><p>
This system, initially piloted in 2011 and slowly rolled out to the city’s over 12,500 traffic signals, relies heavily on NYCWiN, the city-wide broadband wireless network project initially created for emergency first responders. Construction of the network began in 2006 under a $500 million contract with defense contractor Northrop Grumman ($20 million of which came from a DHS grant), and the network  became operational in 2009. Many regarded the project as a failure given its limited use (primarily by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Environmental Protection rather than law enforcement) and exorbitant cost (around $40 million annually just to maintain). The city tried to sell the network back to Northrop Grumman in 2011, but the contractor didn’t want it.
</p><p>
Despite NYCWin’s shortcomings supporting law enforcement, their use in the city’s traffic systems has made it fantastically easy to share traffic data with law enforcement rapidly and seamlessly.
